    <h1>Audioslave Rocks!!</h1>

    <p>
      Audioslave was a rock supergroup formed in Glendale California in 2001. the four piece band 
      consisted of Soundgarden Lead Singer and rhythm guitarrist Chris Cornell with Rage Against the Machine
      members Tom Morello (lead guitar) Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals) and Brad Wilk (Drums) 
      Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine 
      but by the band's second album "Out of Exile" it was noted taht they had established a separate identity.
